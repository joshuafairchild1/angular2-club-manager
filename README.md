## Description

This is a website that allows a user to save details regarding clubs and the people who are members of those clubs. The application supports multiple clubs (though only contains two at the moment) and each club can contain many users. From the homepage the user may select a club, and they will be navigated to a screen that displays the names of the club members, each with their name hyperlinked to a personal information page. Also from the club's page the user may view an "About" page, detailing the club, or they may navigate to a "Admin" page where they may add/update/delete existing member profiles.

This application was created primarily using Angular 2, Firebase and the AngularFire2 library.
